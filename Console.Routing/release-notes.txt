# Default parameters
Default parameter values are now respected for optional parameters

# Capturehelp visible
The capturehelp command 'hijacks' a command path,
and reroutes it to the help commmand. But this command was visible in the help.
It's made invisible

# Shorter help
Help was too verbose. the default help command list display is now
without parameters. They are still in the expanded help for a specific command.
And you can still use the old `RoutingWriter.WriteRoutes(..)`

# Help distinct
Overloaded commands are displayed only once in the shorter help
    
# Uppercase flags
Flags are now treated as case sensitive when abbreviated.
